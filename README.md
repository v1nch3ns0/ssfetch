# ssfetch
Very lightweight fetch script (under 40 lines!!) made for an example package for my package manager [zeropkg](https://github.com/v1nch3ns0/zeropkg).
It has a basic config that can define a `colour` and a `secondary_colour`, its not even close to a final product but i thought
i might aswell put it on here for fun...
